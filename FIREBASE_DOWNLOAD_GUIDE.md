## 📊 Storage Costs & Limits

### Firebase Storage Pricing
- **Free tier**: 5GB storage, 1GB/day downloads
- **Paid tier**: $0.026/GB storage, $0.12/GB downloads

### Download Limits
- **Firebase Console**: 100 files at once

## 🚀 Best Strategy for 2,115 Videos

### For Immediate Access:
1. **Use "Download Links"** from your app
2. **Save the text file** with all URLs
3. **Use download manager** to batch download

### For Long-term Storage:
1. **Keep in Firebase** (permanent, organized)
2. **Use Firebase CLI** for bulk downloads when needed
3. **Set up automated backups** to local storage

### For Sharing:
1. **Firebase gives permanent URLs** that don't expire
2. **Share folder links** from Firebase Console
3. **Create public links** for specific videos

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Download Links Don't Work:
- Check that deployment completed successfully
- Try refreshing the page
- Select fewer videos at once

### If Firebase Upload Fails:
- Check Firebase Storage rules
- Verify environment variables
- Check storage quota

### If Videos Don't Display:
- Clear browser cache
- Check console for errors
- Verify API key is working

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Wait for deployment** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Test Download Links** with a few videos
3. **Let Firebase upload complete** 
4. **Use Firebase CLI** for bulk download of all videos
5. **Set up local backup strategy**
